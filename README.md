# python-functions-for-ml-algorithms

This is a folder of my Python implementations of functions in Machine Learning. 

Some of them are functions for simple algorithms, eg Batch Gradient Descent.

Others are functions that I created for speed and efficiency in a certain task, eg. the binary classification evaluation function.

I hope to add functions as I go along. Although sklearn is an excellent library and I do not necessarily need to create my own
functions, I find that my understanding increases when I implement the 'do-able' algorithms (i.e., I am not going to implement 
an SVM algorithm anytime soon).

You can see most of these functions in action (just to be persuaded that they work as intended) in my mini ML projects [here](https://github.com/s-balachandran/Machine-Learning-Mini-Projects).

The files in this folder are:

1. Linear Regression Gradient Descent - functions for batch gradient descent (linear regression)
2. Logistic Regression Gradient Descent - functions for batch gradient descent (logistic regression)
3. Binary Classification Evaluation - function prints confusion matrix and calculates classification accuracy, null accuracy, 
precision, recall, and the F score
4. kMeans Algorithm - functions for kMeans clustering algorithm
5. Clustering Validation Functions - functions to calculate silhouette score and the average silhouette, plot average silhouette score
for models with clusters in given range,  and for Elbow method
